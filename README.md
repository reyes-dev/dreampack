# Lucid Dreaming App
## Purpose
Have you heard of [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream)? Lucid dreaming is the act of becoming aware that you are in a dream, while
inside of a dream: a notoriously difficult and elusive achievement. This app is an attempt to leverage technology to improve the odds of success. It is a toolkit
or swiss army knife for aspiring lucid dreamers, integrating core fundamentals of the skill: dream journaling, dream recall, reality checks, and dream tracking. 

This app is not a finished product, nor meant to be perfect. As a sort-of beginner software developer, I'm still learning every day and making plenty of mistakes.
This is a project of passion, not profit, addressing challenges I faced as a lucid dreamer in the past. I hope you find it useful or fun.
